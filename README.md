Many PHP applications use relational databases to store and retrieve application information by connecting to SQL database servers.

Alternatively applications can also store information in file base databases that do not require the use of SQL, the so called noSQL databases.

This class provides a pure PHP implementation of a noSQL database that stores and retrieves information in files.

It provideds features to avoid problems caused by concurrent accesses such as the use of proper file locking, among other the non-trivial file database access features.
